#R1CS based Proof systems

This directory contains code to test both Gemini and Groth16. Code within src/ directory is mostly lifted from gakonst's [ark-circom](https://github.com/gakonst/ark-circom) but edited to fix bugs involved with the implementation of circom-2, and updating the code to use the latest 0.4.0alpha version of arkworks (required for testing Gemini)
